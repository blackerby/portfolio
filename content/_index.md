This is [William Blackerby's](https://blackerby.github.io/about/) portfolio of experiences from the [online Master of Library and Information Studies program](https://slis.ua.edu/prospective-students/mlis-distance-options/) at the [University of Alabama School of Library and Information Studies](https://slis.ua.edu/), created and submitted in partial fulfillment of the [requirements for the MLIS degree](https://slis.ua.edu/curriculum/).

Use the menu on the left-hand side of the page to read my [Philosophy]({{< ref "/philosophy" >}}) of LIS Practice, reflections on SLIS's program learning [outcomes]({{< ref "/outcomes" >}}) along with several work samples, and an up-to-date [resume]({{< ref "/resume" >}}). I've also brought over some technical content from my [blog](https://blackerby.github.io) which you can find under the Technology heading in the menu.

Queries entered in the search bar at the top of the left-hand menu will return the names of documents containing your search term. Many of the documents on this site include a table of contents on the right-hand side of the page.

This site was built using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator with the [Hugo Book Theme](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book) and [Hugo Cite](https://labs.loupbrun.ca/hugo-cite/) for citations in my [Philosophy]({{< ref "/philosophy" >}}) of LIS Practice. It was deployed using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
