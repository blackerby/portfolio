## Describe ethical concerns that occur in cataloging work.

In their exploration of what ethical cataloging is, Snow and Shoemaker
(2020) note Intner\'s framing of cataloging ethics \`\`largely in terms
of of institutional responsibilities: the library\'s ability or
inability to meet its users\' needs\'\'
{{< cite "SnowDefiningCatalogingEthics2020" 535 >}}. In other words, ethical
cataloging is about how the library catalog affects the people who use
it.

Ethical concerns in cataloging work center on the authorized terms used
in controlled vocabularies that are applied to resources in the
collections of libraries, archives, and other information organizations.
In particular, these ethical concerns arise around terms used to
describe human identity. Specific examples include terms applied to
gender identity and expression, sexual orientation and identity, race,
ethnicity, and immigration status.

Two of this week\'s resources provide concrete examples of the ethical
concerns mentioned above. Billey, Drabinski, and Roberto (2014) apply
queer theory to the concept of gender in the catalog in their critique
of RDA 9.7. The film _Change the Subject_ details the experiences of
undocumented students at Dartmouth College after encountering the
formerly authorized Library of Congress Subject Heading \`\`illegal
aliens\'\' and their efforts to change the heading. Responses to later
questions will discuss these ethical concerns in more detail.

## How can information found in name and subject authority records be offensive to people?

One of the main ways information found in authority records can be
offensive to people is through misrepresentation.
\`\`Misrepresentation,\'\' according to Smiraglia (2009), \`\`or biased
representation, occurs when a resource is described in terms that are
not consistent with the uses it might engender in a particular
milieu\'\' [@smiragliaBibliocentrismCulturalWarrant2009, p. 675].
_Change the Subject_ provides a powerful, concrete example of this.

Melissa Padilla, a Dartmouth undergraduate at the time, encountered the
authorized Library of Congress Subject Heading \`\`illegal aliens\'\'
while seeking help from Jill Baron, a Dartmouth librarian, in developing
an independent study (Broadley et al., 2019). Padilla\'s reaction is
striking:

> My gut reaction to seeing the subject heading, here at Dartmouth, was
> disgust, and also like perplexed, I was like why? Like, I thought this
> place would know better or do better. Wow, I can\'t believe you think
> these things. I know that there\'s undocumented students here on
> campus and you recruit them, and you still subject them to this sort
> of thing, and it\'s not okay (Broadley et al., 2019, 5:06).

Through this experience Padilla and other members of CoFIRED, the
Dartmouth Coalition for Immigration, Reform, Equality and DREAMers
learned that the offensive term wasn\'t only in use at Dartmouth, but
was in fact part of a national standard (Broadley et al., 2019, 6:29,
21:58). In other words, this was problematic at a national level, and
more people than just Dartmouth undergraduates were being affected.

## How can content standards (e.g., RDA, AACR2) in cataloging be ethically problematic for users of the catalog?

Billey, Drabinkski, and Roberto (2014) argue against the notion that the
gender marker in RDA 9.7 is \`\`an objective description of reality\'\'
and is in fact \`\`passively harmful to transgender individuals\'\'
[@billeyWhatGenderGot2014, p. 414]. RDA, in their analysis, does this by
denying the existence of genders that fall outside the male-female
binary. In other words, library users who identify outside the gender
binary will not see themselves reflected in the catalog.

The same authors note that catalogers, in the quest to provide complete
records, have the leeway \`\`to codify erroneous information\'\'
[@billeyWhatGenderGot2014, p. 418]. They give the example of New Orleans
bounce artist Big Freedia, who, according to a 2011 interview,
\`\`fluidly use\[s\] masculine and feminine pronouns\'\' but identifies
as a gay man [@billeyWhatGenderGot2014, p. 418]. But the cataloger who
created the authority record for Big Freedia made an erroneous
assumption about the artist\'s gender: \`\`The authority record for the
gender-bending hip-hop artist, Big Freedia records his gender as
\`female\'\'\' [@billeyWhatGenderGot2014, p. 418].

Returning to the discussion of the offensive former LCSH term for
undocumented immigrants, in the film _Change the Subject_, Dartmouth
librarian Jill Baron notes how neutrality can in fact be harmful: \`\`I
didn\'t look at the system, the cataloging system as actually an
expression of values. I just sort of saw it as this disassociated,
neutral, organizing principle\'\' (Broadley et al., 2019, 9:59). In the
same film, Dr. Claudia Anguiano Evans-Zepeda, a former faculty advisor
to the Dartmouth student group CoFIRED, succinctly states exactly why
the former subject heading is so offensive: \`\`It\'s wielded most
specifically towards migrants of color and there\'s a racist coding to
it and by virtue of its power it becomes part of the ways in which
anti-immigrant sentiment festers\'\' (Broadley et al., 2019, 11:29).

## Given that cataloging systems are biased, how then do we organize and describe information ethically?

To organize and describe information ethically, we begin by recognizing
that just as the perfect metadata record does not exist, the perfectly
ethical metadata record does not exist either. Cataloging is never
complete; it is an ongoing process, and attention to changing cultural
norms is a part of this process.

One specific way to organize and describe information ethically is to
question standards, which Snow and Shoemaker (2020) define as \`\`not
strictly following standards such as RDA, LCSH, but modifying them at
the local level or attempting to change the standard to better serve
users and/or be more respectful of others; recognizing that standards
are biased\'\' [@snowDefiningCatalogingEthics2020, p. 538].

The same authors argue for working from shared values in the field of
cataloging; they enumerate five such values synthesized from responses
to a questionnaire they shared with catalogers:

> - Accessibility of resources and metadata
> - Awareness of personal, institutional, and standards bias
> - Inclusive metadata and actions
> - Accurate representation of resources and agents
> - Adhering to standards while interrogating their usefulness
>   {{< cite "SnowDefiningCatalogingEthics2020" 543 >}}

Most important, though, is to listen to feedback shared by library
patrons, stakeholders, and other constituents, especially those from
marginalized communities, in the ongoing effort to prevent the library
catalog from causing harm.
