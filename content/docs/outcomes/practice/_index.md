The application of technology to information seeking problems is what drew me to this program, but with a background in community organizing and a decade serving on the boards of non-profit economic and environmental justice organizations, I have felt at home in a school and a profession so oriented toward social and cultural justice. I particularly enjoyed learning about and am fascinated by discussions of ethical cataloging, as is evident from my work sample selections for this learning outcome.

As I say in one of my work samples, I unquestionably come from a privileged background, so I have not directly experienced the harms that can be caused by non-inclusive language used in resource description. As such, discussions of this topic in LS 501: Information in Communities and LS 506: Modern Cataloging and Classification were eye-opening for me. If we take our core values of access, diversity, the public good, service, and social responsibility seriously, we must take ethical cataloging seriously. In my LS 501 work sample I discuss the specific instance of the University of Washington Libraries' publication of a statement on harmful language in catalog records and archival finding aids and give a general overview of critical cataloging. In my LS 506 work sample I engage in a slightly more technical discussion involving how metadata standards like RDA can intersect with a cataloger's judgment to do harm and, in some cases, just be plain wrong.

My two work samples demonstrate how these courses have equipped me, someone seeking to become a metadata practitioner, with the vocabulary and tools to engage in critical conversations about cataloging and metadata records.
