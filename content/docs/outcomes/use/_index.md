Evidence-based practice is essential to many professions, and librarianship is no exception. Librarians and information professionals should be well-versed in the literature of the field and attentive to standards, best practices, and recommendations. They should be comfortable evaluating their own practices against these standards, open to changing their practices based on these evaluations, and willing to engage in processes to suggest revisions to these standards as research in the field progresses.

The two selected work samples demonstrate my proficiency with this learning outcome. The first, drawn from LS 506: Modern Cataloging and Classification, discusses methods for evaluating the quality of cataloging and metadata. For this assignment, I engaged with four articles from _Cataloging & Classification Quarterly_ concerning topics including data quality, the idea of the "perfect" bibliographic record (there isn't one), and the definition and assessment of quality cataloging. I appreciate how this assignment gently introduced us to the scholarly literature and evidence-based practice in cataloging and classification.

The second work sample, drawn from LS 535: Records Management, provided me with the opportunity to engage with a legal advisory issued by the National Association of Independent Schools concerning records retention and draft a memorandum making recommendations based on this industry publication. I can foresee myself doing similar work in my career, and I was glad to have the practice.
