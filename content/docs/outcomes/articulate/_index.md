The American Library Association's Core Values of Librarianship [1] are foundational to the practice of librarianship in the many diverse forms it takes. What ties together those core values of access, confidentiality and privacy, democracy, diversity, education and lifelong learning, intellectual freedom, the public good, preservation, professionalism, service, social responsibility, and sustainability is a focus on equitable treatment of people. People are the information seekers we serve, and people come from an enormous range of experiences, backgrounds, and life circumstances. Librarians treat information seekers equitably, regardless of who they are. In practice, I believe this looks like meeting our users where they are. For example, one user may be a skilled catalog searcher, and another may never have used a computer before. It is the librarian's job to be fully present and attentive to each user's needs.

The two work samples I chose to demonstrate my understanding of this learning outcome both come from LS 501: Information in Communities. The first, a response to assigned readings about scholarly communication, relates to the ALA Core Value of Access and is a discussion of how the publication of scholarly communication has changed and grown in complexity with the advent of the World Wide Web. It also engages with how the Western, global north conceptualization of information does not reflect the way much of the world's population conceives of information. The second, the final essay assignment for LS 501, discusses the interplay between the ALA Core Values of Access and the Public Good, the question of neutrality in libraries, information services and diverse communities, and offers a reflection on my time in the course. Both work samples demonstrate how I have engaged with the philosophy, principles, and ethics of library and information science through my coursework.
