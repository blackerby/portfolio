Learning to use and develop technological solutions to improve the information seeking experience is what drew me to this program. Through my coursework, I have encountered a range of technologies I was previously unaware of and grown more proficient with technologies I had worked with before. LS 566: Metadata Fundamentals opened my eyes to the world of the semantic web and linked data and the technologies and standards used to implement them. LS 569: Database Management has challenged me to grapple with some of the finer points of relational database management systems. These courses were some of my favorites in the program.

The name of this program learning outcome is a good reminder for a technology enthusiast like me that the tools we use in librarianship are to be used in the service of improving access to information resources. With that in mind, I believe that my two work samples demonstrate my ability to evaluate technologies that mediate access to information resources. The first work sample is an analysis of the Williams College Libraries digital collection development policy, submitted for an assignment in LS 562: Digital Libraries. Through this assignment I learned the importance of careful, deliberate planning when creating and maintaining a digital library project. The second work sample, taken from LS 566: Metadata Fundamentals, is a discussion of problems that can arise when collection metadata is not adequately stewarded. This assignment helped me learn about the importance of and the labor that goes into creating and maintaining high-quality metadata.
