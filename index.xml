I ended up learning a ton about Unix text processing workhorses like aspell, awk, diff, find, grep, sed, and GNU Emacs as well as newer tools like Miller and Datasette. I incorporated these tools into several shell scripts to expedite my workflow, which is built around a python script I wrote to extract specific text from the PDF I was working with using regular expressions.</description></item><item><title>2. prep.sh and mlr</title><link>https://blackerby.github.io/portfolio/docs/technology/metadata/2022-11-23-prep/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blackerby.github.io/portfolio/docs/technology/metadata/2022-11-23-prep/</guid><description>prep.sh and mlr # I am an inexperienced shell scripter, but this project provided opportunities to do some productive work with the shell.

Initially, I was doing all of this work on the command line, using iTerm2 on my Mac. I had a script that ran aspell on each text file before opening Neovim for each file for manual review. It worked fine, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t very flexible, and to be honest, I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to become proficient in Emacs.</description></item><item><title>5. cleanup.sh</title><link>https://blackerby.github.io/portfolio/docs/technology/metadata/2022-11-25-cleanup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blackerby.github.io/portfolio/docs/technology/metadata/2022-11-25-cleanup/</guid><description>cleanup.sh # With the text files edited, it&amp;rsquo;s time to clean up a little bit.

Critical Cataloging: An LIS Hot Topic
As part of their university libraries&amp;rsquo; commitment to equity, diversity, inclusion, and anti-racism, metadata specialists at the University of Washington published a statement on harmful language in catalog records and archival finding aids in August of 2021 (Casey et al., &amp;ldquo;Words Matter&amp;rdquo;). UW Libraries&amp;rsquo; publication of their &amp;ldquo;Critical Cataloging and Archival Description&amp;rdquo; statement takes place in the context of the ongoing, broader national conversation about equity, diversity, and inclusion prompted by systemic police violence and killings of unarmed Black people and brought to a head by the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin in May of 2020.</description></item><item><title>LS 501: Final Essays</title><link>https://blackerby.github.io/portfolio/docs/outcomes/articulate/finalessays501/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blackerby.github.io/portfolio/docs/outcomes/articulate/finalessays501/</guid><description>William Blackerby

The amount of information available to our communities continues to grow and contribute to increasing both information overload and misinformation. Reputable information is often difficult to find or inaccessible due to paywalls, discoverability challenges, institutional and socio-cultural biases, and other impediments.</description></item><item><title>LS 501: Scholarly Communication Reading Response</title><link>https://blackerby.github.io/portfolio/docs/outcomes/articulate/rr501/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blackerby.github.io/portfolio/docs/outcomes/articulate/rr501/</guid><description>William Blackerby

Scholarly Communication Reading Response
Prior to my engagement with the assigned readings on scholarly communication, besides knowing that peer review is important in the process, I had little idea of how scholarly journals are published. In fact, I was somewhat skeptical of why something that seemed as narrowly focused as academic publishing needed a week&amp;rsquo;s worth of our attention in this class.</description></item><item><title>LS 506: Ethical Cataloging Discussion Questions</title><link>https://blackerby.github.io/portfolio/docs/outcomes/practice/discussion-questions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blackerby.github.io/portfolio/docs/outcomes/practice/discussion-questions/</guid><description>Describe ethical concerns that occur in cataloging work. # In their exploration of what ethical cataloging is, Snow and Shoemaker (2020) note Intner's framing of cataloging ethics ``largely in terms of of institutional responsibilities: the library's ability or inability to meet its users' needs'' ( Citation: Snow&amp;#32;&amp;amp;&amp;#32;Shoemaker,&amp;#32;2020,&amp;#32;p.&amp;nbsp;535 Snow,&amp;#32; K.&amp;#32;&amp;amp;&amp;#32;Shoemaker,&amp;#32; B. &amp;#32; (2020). &amp;#32;Defining Cataloging Ethics: Practitioner Perspectives.

The digital collection services of the Williams College Special Collections seeks to collect, manage, preserve and disseminate digital objects that support the educational mission of the College, are in need of preservation, are part of the history of the College, and are rare and unique. [@DigitalCollections, para. 1]
In this first part of this paper I will describe and analyze the Williams College Standards, Policies and Procedures for Digital Collections the using the framework presented in Xie and Matusiak's Discover Digital Libraries: Theory and Practice [@xieDiscoverDigitalLibraries2016b].</description></item><item><title>LS 566: Metadata Quality Problems</title><link>https://blackerby.github.io/portfolio/docs/outcomes/evaluate/mqp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blackerby.github.io/portfolio/docs/outcomes/evaluate/mqp/</guid><description>William Blackerby

Assignment #2: Metadata quality problems
In their article &amp;ldquo;Achieving and Maintaining Metadata Quality: Toward a Sustainable Workflow for the IDEALS Institutional Repository,&amp;rdquo; Stein, Applegate, and Robbins give a useful overview of the kinds of metadata quality problems that can occur in collections before detailing how they developed a workflow to address metadata problems in the institutional repository they manage. Here I will summarize the kinds of problems they discuss.</description></item><item><title>Philosophy of LIS Practice</title><link>https://blackerby.github.io/portfolio/docs/philosophy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blackerby.github.io/portfolio/docs/philosophy/</guid><description>A Reflective Essay on Information, Technology, Humanity, and Purpose # I distinctly remember what first piqued my interest in computing and technology.
