</code></pre><h1 id=introduction>Introduction
<a class=anchor href=#introduction>#</a></h1><p>According to their
<a href=https://specialcollections.williams.edu/collection-development-policies/digital-collections/>website</a>,</p><blockquote><p>The digital collection services of the Williams College Special
Collections seeks to collect, manage, preserve and disseminate digital
objects that support the educational mission of the College, are in
need of preservation, are part of the history of the College, and are
rare and unique. [@DigitalCollections, para. 1]</p></blockquote><p>In this first part of this paper I will describe and analyze the
Williams College Standards, Policies and Procedures for Digital
Collections the using the framework presented in Xie and Matusiak's
<em>Discover Digital Libraries: Theory and Practice</em>
[@xieDiscoverDigitalLibraries2016b]. As part of this analysis and
description, I will investigate the extent to which the Williams College
digital library collection development policies take project costs and
project funding into account.</p><p>In the second part of this paper, I will enumerate and describe digital
services offered by Williams College Special Collections.</p><h1 id=digital-collection-development-policy-analysis>Digital Collection Development Policy Analysis
<a class=anchor href=#digital-collection-development-policy-analysis>#</a></h1><p>Xie and Matusiak present the California Digital Library (CDL) collection
development framework as an example of a digital library collection
development policy [@xieDiscoverDigitalLibraries2016b, p. 39].</p><blockquote><p>The California Digital Library (CDL) is a ``co-library'' of the
University of California whose primary collection responsibility is to
develop electronic content and make it available to all faculty and
students. Some of the electronic content will be licensed and acquired
from commercial sources, and some will be produced by digitizing
University collections. The same three considerations used to develop
library collections in the ten UC campus libraries guide collection
development for the CDL:</p><ul><li>The user base</li><li>The programs that are to be supported</li><li>The resources available to support those users and programs
[@CollectionDevelopmentFramework, para. 1]</li></ul></blockquote><p>Below, I present an analysis of Williams College Standards, Policies,
and Procedures for Digital Collections using the CDL framework.</p><h2 id=user-base>User Base
<a class=anchor href=#user-base>#</a></h2><p>Given that the Williams College Special Collections, of which the
Digital Collections are a part, are housed at an academic institution,
it is safe to assume that the primary user base are the faculty and
students of Williams College. This is not explicitly stated within the
Collection Development policies, but can be inferred from other Special
Collections policies. For example, the Access and Use Policies state
that items ``in Special Collections are acquired and preserved in
order to support research in all areas of the Williams curriculum''
[@AccessUsePoliciesa, para. 1]. Additionally, class visits to Williams
College Special Collections are available for ``facilitating student
engagement with primary sources and object-based learning''
[@ClassVisits, para. 1]. Special Collections staff is also ``happy to
help select material and work with faculty to structure a class''
[@ClassVisits, para. 2]. Librarians and archivists are also available
for one-on-one appointments to assist with research projects
[@ResearchAppointments, para. 1].</p><p>Though it is clear that the primary user base of the Williams College
Special Collections is the College's faculty and students, the Access
and Use Policies clearly state that ``[y]ou do not need to be
affiliated with Williams in order to use our collections''
[@AccessUsePoliciesa, para. 1].</p><h2 id=supported-programs>Supported Programs
<a class=anchor href=#supported-programs>#</a></h2><p>There is no explicit enumeration of programs supported by the Williams
College digital collection services in the policy documents, but they do
state that ``[t]he development of digital collections is in keeping
with Special Collections' intention to describe, arrange, digitize, and
disseminate our collections and to provide `the retention,
preservation, and research use of its collections'''
[@DigitalCollections, para. 2]. More specifically, ``[t]he focus of
the Williams College's [sic] Digital Collections is unique or rare
content from collections owned by Special Collections or the College at
large'' [@DigitalCollections, Scope]. In other words, the programs
supported by the Williams College digital collection services are the
programs of Williams College Special Collections more broadly.</p><h2 id=resources-available>Resources Available
<a class=anchor href=#resources-available>#</a></h2><p>The Digital Collections policy document states that</p><blockquote><p>Digital Collections are composed of digital objects, whether
born-digital or digitized, regardless of item type. Text, audio, still
and moving images, datasets, etc. are all included. Collecting
activities focus on content that can be made accessible to a wide
audience [@DigitalCollections, para. 3].</p></blockquote><p>Within the scope of Williams College Digital Collections are ``other
types of open access scholarly materials (for example, data sets, data
visualizations, creative works, working papers, preprints, publications,
etc.)'' [@DigitalCollections, Scope]. ``Unique and rare content''
from Special Collections may be made available ``through digitization
of selected analog materials or through the transfer of born-digital
content'' [@DigitalCollections, para. 3].</p><p>Furthermore,</p><blockquote><p>Special Collections is highly supportive of collections that:</p><ol><li>Represent the cultural, geographic, economic, and political
diversity of Williams College.</li><li>Constitute objects for which access would be improved by inclusion
in Special Collections: linking between items, innovative ways to
comprehend the material, etc.</li><li>May be difficult to access physically.</li><li>Comprise materials that are in need of preservation.</li><li>Complement existing digital content.</li><li>Have materials that are dispersed. [@DigitalCollections, Scope]</li></ol></blockquote><p>Digitization of ``non-unique images for teaching'' falls outside the
scope of the Digital Collections policy document [@DigitalCollections,
Scope].</p><h2 id=project-costs-and-funding>Project Costs and Funding
<a class=anchor href=#project-costs-and-funding>#</a></h2><h3 id=capacity-constraint>Capacity Constraint
<a class=anchor href=#capacity-constraint>#</a></h3><p>Weber et al. define collection management as ``[a]ll of the
activities that are necessary to ensure that collection material is
described, discoverable, and available for use,'' including
``accessioning and processing, cataloging, conservation, and
digitization,'' the latter of which is of particular interest in this
paper [@weberTotalCostStewardship2021, p. 2]. Weber et al. also move
beyond budgetary constraints on collecting and by introducing the
capacity constraint model into collection development. They define
capacity constraint broadly as ``[f]actors that limit production,
performance, or output'' and specifically in the context of collection
development they say that ``a capacity constraint impacts an
institution's ability to accomplish collection management
activities'' [@weberTotalCostStewardship2021, p. 3].</p><h3 id=collaborative-decision-making>Collaborative Decision Making
<a class=anchor href=#collaborative-decision-making>#</a></h3><p>Weber et al. state that ``[i]nformed decision-making around
collections requires that everyone involved in the lifecycle of
collection stewardship has a shared understanding of when and how
various decisions are made, and by whom''
[@weberTotalCostStewardship2021, p. 13]. Furthermore, ``[e]nsuring
that information is exchanged when and as needed is typically easier
said than done, especially in large organizations and over extended
periods of time'' [@weberTotalCostStewardship2021, p. 13].</p><h3 id=capacity-constraint-and-collaborative-decision-making-at-williams-college-special-collections>Capacity Constraint and Collaborative Decision Making at Williams College Special Collections
<a class=anchor href=#capacity-constraint-and-collaborative-decision-making-at-williams-college-special-collections>#</a></h3><p>Though there is no comprehensive discussion of project costs and
funding, the digital collection development policy document does note
that some digitization activities fall into the category of
``[s]pecially-funded digitization projects made possible through
grants or gifts'' and ``may involve additional short-term staff and
will likely be subject to specific deadlines and special project
parameters'' [@DigitalCollections, Digitization]. This can be
interpreted as an increase in capacity in the short term for specific
projects. There is also an endowed fund, the John T. Gibson '35
Williamsiana Fund, for the support of Special Collections
[@GivingCollegeArchives].</p><p>The Digital Collections services of Special collections does ``not
digitize or accept digitized versions of inactive analog records of
enduring value that have not been officially transferred to the Special
Collections, though Special Collections reserves the right to make
exceptions if warranted'' [@DigitalCollections, Scope]. This can be
read as a capacity-conserving decision. In other words, digitization is
not an endlessly available service, and certain channels must be
followed by those who want to engaged the service.</p><p>There is also no comprehensive discussion of collaborative decision
making in the reviewed policy documents. Perhaps this is because
Williams College Library and Special Collections are a small
organization given that Williams is a liberal arts college and not a
large research university. Nevertheless, the Digital Collections policy
document does note that decisions regarding the removal of materials
``will be made in conjunction with the Digital Resources
Archivist/Records Manager, Archivist, Director of Libraries, and others
as appropriate and will be handled on a case by case basis''
[@DigitalCollections, Maintenance and removal]. This is in line with
Weber et al.'s discussion of collaborative decision making.</p><h1 id=digital-library-services-description>Digital Library Services Description
<a class=anchor href=#digital-library-services-description>#</a></h1><h2 id=legalcopyright-services>Legal/Copyright Services
<a class=anchor href=#legalcopyright-services>#</a></h2><p>Williams College Library and Special Collections do not provide any
legal or copyright services, per se, but they do invite patrons to
``use materials in the public domain and to make fair use of
copyrighted materials as defined by copyright law''
[@AccessUsePoliciesa, Copyright and permissions]. Items ``in the
public domain can be added to a collection without obtaining permission
from anyone'' [@xieDiscoverDigitalLibraries2016b, p. 44]. Fair use
``is a powerful tool for using [copyrighted] works without obtaining
permission'' [@xieDiscoverDigitalLibraries2016b, p. 47].</p><p>Smith (2012) outlines approaches libraries can take to protect
themselves from potential litigation regarding copyright violations
[@smithCopyrightRiskManagement2012]. Williams College Special
Collections emphasizes the users' responsibility for ``determining
whether [their] use is fair and for responding to any claims that may
arise from [their] use'' [@AccessUsePoliciesa, Copyright and
permissions]. Regarding digital collections, specifically, Special
Collections ``may need to restrict access to the College&rsquo;s records in
order to adhere to copyright laws or restriction periods''
[@DigitalCollections, para. 3]. Special Collections encourages items and
collections that ``[h]ave copyright clearance if the copyright is
not held by the submitter/s or Williams College''
[@DigitalCollections, Scope]. See the section on ``Maintenance and
Removal'' below for more information on how Williams College Special
Collections handles copyright infringement and disputes.</p><h2 id=personal-archiving>Personal Archiving
<a class=anchor href=#personal-archiving>#</a></h2><p>Williams College Special Collections ``encourage[s] potential
contributors interested in digitizing their own content in preparation
to be added to Special Collections, to coordinate with the Digital
Resources Archivist/Records Manager in advance to establish the correct
digitization methods'' [@DigitalCollections, Personal archiving].</p><h2 id=associated-analog-material>Associated Analog Material
<a class=anchor href=#associated-analog-material>#</a></h2><p>Williams College Special Collections requires that ``inactive records
of enduring value&mldr;be transferred to Special Collections before that
content can be added to the digital collections''
[@DigitalCollections, Associated analog material]. This allows ``staff
to have continued access to analog original materials in case
re-digitization is ever necessary'' [@DigitalCollections, Associated
analog material].</p><h2 id=digitization-services>Digitization Services
<a class=anchor href=#digitization-services>#</a></h2><p>``Digitization is the process of creating digital representations of
information resources recorded on analog carriers''
[@xieDiscoverDigitalLibraries2016b, p. 59]. The Williams College Digital
Collections policy document identifies three categories digitization
work is likely to fall into.</p><ul><li>Ongoing digitization of whole (or large portions of) collections.
This work is not subject to specific deadlines.</li><li>Project-specific digitization work, typically tied to grant-funding
or gifts.</li><li>Scan on Demand, or digitization that is based on user request of
rare or unique materials.</li></ul><p>[@DigitalCollections, Digitization]</p><h2 id=metadata-services>Metadata Services
<a class=anchor href=#metadata-services>#</a></h2><p>Williams College Special Collections collects and produces metadata for
collections and items in those collections. Metadata Object Description
Schema (MODS) is the standard schema used, but other schemata ``may be
employed to support different projects/collections''
[@DigitalCollections, Organization and metadata].</p><p>Before collections are digitized by Williams College Special
Collections, they must be organized and described, but ``item-level
metadata may be created as part of the development of a digital
collection'' [@DigitalCollections, Organization and metadata].</p><h2 id=digital-preservation-services>Digital Preservation Services
<a class=anchor href=#digital-preservation-services>#</a></h2><p>Williams College Special Collections is the designated repository for
rare books, records of Williams College, select professional work of
faculty and alumni, and other collections in support of the curriculum.
As such, Special Collections ``assumes primary responsibility for long
term preservation of its digital holdings'' [@DigitalCollections,
Preservation].</p><h2 id=maintenance-and-removal>Maintenance and Removal
<a class=anchor href=#maintenance-and-removal>#</a></h2><p>Special Collections aims to develop ``digital collections that are of
high quality, useful and usable, and cohesive'' [@DigitalCollections,
Maintenance and removal]. Doing so may necessitate removal of individual
objects or entire collections ``for reasons of violation of copyright
or copyright dispute, inaccurate data or facts, collection weeding,
storage, or the material is no longer in support of the Williams
scholarly community'' [@DigitalCollections, Maintenance and removal].
In some cases, removal will be noted in metadata in order to preserve
historical record [@DigitalCollections, Maintenance and removal].</p><h2 id=collections-as-data>``Collections as Data''
<a class=anchor href=#collections-as-data>#</a></h2><p>Browsing the Williams College Library and Special Collections web pages,
I was not able to find any mention or description of text data mining
services or AI/ML services. When used with the website's search tool,
the search terms ``text data mining'' and ``AI/ML'' did not
return any results on the College's library or special collections web
pages. Instead, results pointed to course offerings within the
College's computer science department. Nevertheless, Special
Collections does provide a web archiving service, in effect building a
collection that could be mined as data, but does not appear to have been
mined yet, at least under the auspices of Williams College Special
Collections [@WebArchiving].</p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div><script>(function(){function e(e){const t=window.getSelection(),n=document.createRange();n.selectNodeContents(e),t.removeAllRanges(),t.addRange(n)}document.querySelectorAll("pre code").forEach(t=>{t.addEventListener("click",function(){if(window.getSelection().toString())return;e(t.parentElement),navigator.clipboard&&navigator.clipboard.writeText(t.parentElement.textContent)})})})()</script></footer><div class=book-comments></div><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#user-base>User Base</a></li><li><a href=#supported-programs>Supported Programs</a></li><li><a href=#resources-available>Resources Available</a></li><li><a href=#project-costs-and-funding>Project Costs and Funding</a><ul><li><a href=#capacity-constraint>Capacity Constraint</a></li><li><a href=#collaborative-decision-making>Collaborative Decision Making</a></li><li><a href=#capacity-constraint-and-collaborative-decision-making-at-williams-college-special-collections>Capacity Constraint and Collaborative Decision Making at Williams College Special Collections</a></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><a href=#legalcopyright-services>Legal/Copyright Services</a></li><li><a href=#personal-archiving>Personal Archiving</a></li><li><a href=#associated-analog-material>Associated Analog Material</a></li><li><a href=#digitization-services>Digitization Services</a></li><li><a href=#metadata-services>Metadata Services</a></li><li><a href=#digital-preservation-services>Digital Preservation Services</a></li><li><a href=#maintenance-and-removal>Maintenance and Removal</a></li><li><a href=#collections-as-data>``Collections as Data''</a></li></ul></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
