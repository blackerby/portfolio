<a class=anchor href=#discuss-the-different-ways-we-can-assess-the-quality-of-cataloging>#</a></h1><p>Any discussion of the quality of cataloging needs to begin with a
definition of quality cataloging. Snow states that</p><blockquote><p>In cataloging literature, &ldquo;quality cataloging&rdquo; has been defined in the
following ways:</p><ul><li>Accurate bibliographic information that meets users&rsquo; needs and
provides appropriate access in a timely fashion.</li><li>What library users say it is.</li><li>Level of content (AACR2 level of description, inclusion of subject
classification or subject headings, authority control of headings,
etc.)&mldr;accuracy of content (in transcription from the item, in
conformity with the standards applied)&mldr;fitness for purpose.</li><li>We define quality for support staff by percentage error rate in
the following: selection or suitability of OCLC record as a match
for item cataloged; correcting typographical errors in the
following fields: 100, 245, 260, 300, 5xx; making appropriate
edits to bibliographic and holdings records; accurate creation of
item and holdings records; recognizing cataloging problems and
bringing them to the attention of a supervisor. For cataloging
librarians: quality is defined by excellent original cataloging
based on AACR2 full-level standards; name authority records
created to standards set by NACO; effective supervision of support
staff, including timely resolution of questions and problems; a
reasonable turnaround time for materials so that a backlog is not
created or growing; responsiveness to needs of internal and
external patrons; completeness, efficiency, responsive to queries
and complaints. [@snowDefiningAssessingRethinking2017, pp.<blockquote><p>438-439]</p></blockquote></li></ul></blockquote><p>Keeping in mind that data quality and quality cataloging are separate
but perhaps overlapping concepts, the definition of data quality
presented in Badovinac (2021) in the context of evaluating quality of
cataloging in the Slovenian union bibliographic database is applicable
to multiple contexts:</p><blockquote><p>Quality data is present in a unique bibliographic or authority record
and it is not redundant. It is structurally consistent, structurally
complete, semantically accurate, syntactically accurate, value
complete, semantically coherent, representationally consistent,
current, and may have added value. [@badovinacDefiningDataQuality2021,</p><blockquote><p>p. 366]</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Ultimately, though, there is no one size fits all definition, so quality
cataloging needs to be defined based on institutional context and
institutional priorities or goals. Perhaps the best way to evaluate
quality of cataloging is to respond to the following questions presented
in Bade (2008)</p><blockquote><ol><li>What data elements are useful for the kind of library research
performed here in this particular institution?</li><li>How much, and which elements of that necessary information can
this institution afford to support? (This means either creating it
initially, correcting or adding it to bibliographic records
imported from external sources, and future maintenance in cases of
changing standards, new headings, data definitions, etc.)
[@badePerfectBibliographicRecord2008, p. 129].</li></ol></blockquote><h1 id=how-often-should-we-be-evaluating-our-cataloging-if-quality-is-always-changing>How often should we be evaluating our cataloging if quality is always changing?
<a class=anchor href=#how-often-should-we-be-evaluating-our-cataloging-if-quality-is-always-changing>#</a></h1><p>Badovinac (2021) presents several methods used for assessing and
improving data quality in the Slovenian union bibliographic database,
including ``regular reviews of records that were made by beginning
catalogers, identification of record groups with common error patterns,
yearly reviews of 100 randomly selected records, and continuous
monitoring of the recently created bibliographic records and authority
records'' [@badovinacDefiningDataQuality2021, p. 361]. Badovinac goes
on to provide more detail on the continuous monitoring of bibliographic
and authority records, also known as daily production monitoring,
stating that ``[i]ts primary goal is to correct and resolve the
errors in recently created records''
[@badovinacDefiningDataQuality2021, p. 361]. The monitoring method is
conducted by random sampling of metadata; records are reviewed without a
resource in hand, then recommendations are made to catalogers who can
correct their records with a resource in hand. The process is completed
within six days after creation and sampling of records
[@badovinacDefiningDataQuality2021, p. 361].</p><p>In addition to providing a practical answer to the previous question of
how to assess quality of cataloging, Badovinac gives a detailed answer
to the question of how frequently cataloging should be evaluated. The
short, but broad, answer is ``continuously.'' A practical, effective
definition of ``continuously'' is going to depend on institutional
goals and capacity constraints, specifically constraints imposed by
finances and labor availability.</p><h1 id=should-the-quality-of-cataloging-be-determined-by-the-local-needs-of-a-library-or-by-the-broader-cataloging-community>Should the quality of cataloging be determined by the local needs of a library or by the broader cataloging community?
<a class=anchor href=#should-the-quality-of-cataloging-be-determined-by-the-local-needs-of-a-library-or-by-the-broader-cataloging-community>#</a></h1><p>Standards are essential to quality cataloging, but the local needs of a
library should have the final say in assessing quality of cataloging.
Snow says it best: ``While standardization of bibliographic data
remains important (especially now since machines need to read and act
upon this data on the web), standardization without concern for user
needs does not produce quality cataloging''
[@snowDefiningAssessingRethinking2017, p. 450]. Snow further states that
``the developers of cataloging standards have largely neglected to
study users as part of the development process and therefore current
standards may not accurately reflect the needs of modern library
users'' [@snowDefiningAssessingRethinking2017, p. 447]. Every library
user is different, and every library is different, so libraries should
follow Snow's recommendation to ``[c]onduct a study of user
information needs to determine what information is important to users at
[their] institution and try to accommodate those needs in a way that
is financially feasible, as suggested by Bade''
[@snowDefiningAssessingRethinking2017, p. 451].</p><h1 id=how-do-we-balance-the-needs-of-library-users-and-catalogers-when-it-comes-to-improving-the-quality-of-cataloging>How do we balance the needs of library users and catalogers when it comes to improving the quality of cataloging?
<a class=anchor href=#how-do-we-balance-the-needs-of-library-users-and-catalogers-when-it-comes-to-improving-the-quality-of-cataloging>#</a></h1><p>The balance needs to be tilted in favor library users, and catalogers
should recognize that their work is primarily for library users. As Bade
says, ``[u]sers of the library do not need bibliographic records at
all, perfect or not. What they want is to find what they are looking
for'' [@badePerfectBibliographicRecord2008, p. 125]. That said, Flynn
and Kilkenny illustrate how poor quality records can impede the user
experience and the cataloger's ability to improve the user experience.
For example, ``[v]endor provided MARC records can vary in quality
which affects the amount of time needed for cataloging''
[@flynnCatalogingCenterImproving2017, p. 632]. This can lead to backlogs
which limit findability of items in a library's collections. Flynn and
Kilkenny explain that institutions like Duke University have policies in
place that reduce cataloging to core needs in order to increase staff
productivity [@flynnCatalogingCenterImproving2017, p. 632]. OhioLINK, on
the other hand, ``does full-level cataloging, ensuring that call
numbers and subject headings are included and that descriptive metadata
is accurate, especially the title field and author(s)/editor(s)''
[@flynnCatalogingCenterImproving2017, p. 635]. Furthermore, record
maintenance projects in the OhioLINK consortium ``prioritize user
access as well as record standardization and consistency to ensure all
e-book records meet current consortial cataloging standards''
[@flynnCatalogingCenterImproving2017, p. 638].</p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div><script>(function(){function e(e){const t=window.getSelection(),n=document.createRange();n.selectNodeContents(e),t.removeAllRanges(),t.addRange(n)}document.querySelectorAll("pre code").forEach(t=>{t.addEventListener("click",function(){if(window.getSelection().toString())return;e(t.parentElement),navigator.clipboard&&navigator.clipboard.writeText(t.parentElement.textContent)})})})()</script></footer><div class=book-comments></div><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
